# Browser Battery Test

This Python script automates browser usage to test battery consumption.

## Usage

1.  Install the required libraries: `pip install pyautogui`
2.  Modify the `browser_path` in the script to your browser's executable path.
3.  Run the script: `python battery_test.py`

## Important Notes

* Battery consumption results may vary depending on hardware and operating system.
* This script automates browser activity; you'll need separate tools to measure actual battery usage.
